# Revealdle
Wordle, but with a limited amount of letter reveals.

## How to Play

- After submitting each guess, three of the five letters must be clicked to reveal their color.
- Users have eight guesses instead of the standard six.

## Features
- A new word each day (the word one year ahead of Wordle).
- A theme swapper that cycles through seven different themes.
- The option to use a filler letter.
- A new word button to play infinitely.

## Major Known Issues
- Revealdle does not resize well on mobile devices.
